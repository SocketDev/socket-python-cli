# Changelog

## 2.2.69

- Added `--reach-enable-analysis-splitting` flag to enable analysis splitting (disabled by default).
- Added `--reach-detailed-analysis-log-file` flag to print detailed analysis log file path.
- Added `--reach-lazy-mode` flag to enable lazy mode for reachability analysis.
- Changed default behavior: analysis splitting is now disabled by default. The old `--reach-disable-analysis-splitting` flag is kept as a hidden no-op for backwards compatibility.

## 2.2.64

- Included PyPy in the Docker image.

## 2.2.57

- Fixed Dockerfile to set `GOROOT` to `/usr/lib/go` when using system Go (`GO_VERSION=system`) instead of always using `/usr/local/go`.

## 2.2.56

- Removed process timeout from reachability analysis subprocess. Timeouts are now only passed to the Coana CLI via the `--analysis-timeout` flag.
